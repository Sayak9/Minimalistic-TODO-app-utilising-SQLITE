 A minimalistic TODO app in which a task and it's completion status can be created, read, updated and deleted (CRUD) by the user. Here are the key features:

* **SQLite Integration:** Leverages SQFlite for robust, offline task storage, ensuring data persistence even without internet access.
* **Database Service:** Provides a clean separation between the UI and data access logic, promoting code maintainability and reusability.
* **Task Model:** Defines a `Task` class with properties like `id`, `content`, and `status` for efficient task representation and manipulation.
* **User-friendly UI:** Offers a straightforward interface with a floating action button for adding tasks and a scrollable list displaying existing tasks with checkboxes for marking completion.
* **CRUD Operations:** Implements functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks within the database.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

* **Flutter Development:** Building mobile applications with smooth UI animations and state management.
* **Database Management:** Utilizing SQFlite to interact with an SQLite database, ensuring data persistence.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Designing a `Task` model class for better code organization and data representation.

I have designed the codebase with a strong foundation which can potentially be used for building more complex task management applications with additional features like due dates, priorities, and categories.
